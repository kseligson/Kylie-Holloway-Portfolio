    <!-- Description -->
      <div class = "description">
      <p> Kylie Holloway is an actor, director, and improviser.</p>
  <p>She graduated from UC San Diego in 2015 with a B.A. (Honors) in International Studies and Theatre. While there she fell in love with all the elements of the theater-making process, from set design to dramaturgy to performance. She was chair of the student theater production organization, Company 157, and oversaw the development of 13 student plays. UCSD granted her the opportunity to experiment with viewpoints, improvisation as part of the rehearsal process, and staging site-specific theater.</p> 
  <p>She also was the creator, co-writer, and director of the webseries Unilateral, based on her time as an intern at the CA state capitol. Links to the three episodes are available below.
In August of 2016, Kylie will be graduating from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School with a M.A. in International Professional Acting. The program has been both immensely challenging and rewarding. The students are currently preparing for a production of Frankenstein, produced as part of the Bristol Festival of Ideas. Our final production will be a devised rendition of Jane Austenâ€™s gothic satire Northanger Abbey, June 23-28.</p>
